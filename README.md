# Yii3 application-server benchmarks

This repository measures the same Yii3 API application on several PHP application servers under repeatable,
constant-throughput HTTP load. All runtime implementations live together on `master`, use the same application code,
database seed, benchmark client, and report generator, and can be run individually or as one batch.

The suite is intended for comparing runtime behavior—not for declaring a universally fastest server. Results depend
on the host, Docker version, CPU scheduling, runtime configuration, request rate, and benchmark duration. Compare runs
made on the same machine with the same settings and minimal background activity.

## What is included

| Runtime key | Application server | Execution model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `frankenphp-classic` | FrankenPHP | A normal PHP application bootstrap for each request |
| `frankenphp-worker` | FrankenPHP | A persistent Yii worker |
| `roadrunner` | RoadRunner | A persistent Yii worker managed by RoadRunner |
| `php-fpm` | PHP-FPM + Nginx | Traditional FastCGI processes behind Nginx |
| `freeunit` | FreeUnit | PHP application hosted by FreeUnit; grouped with non-worker runtimes |
| `rapira` | Rapira worker | A persistent Yii worker using [yii-runner-rapira](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii-runner-rapira) |
| `rapira-classic` | Rapira classic | A fresh Yii application per request; grouped with non-worker runtimes |
| `rapira-dispatcher` | Rapira dispatcher | A persistent Yii application using Rapira exchanges; grouped with worker runtimes |
| `oxphp` | OxPHP worker | A persistent Yii worker using `worker-oxphp.php` |
| `oxphp-classic` | OxPHP classic | A fresh Yii application per request through `public/index.php`; grouped with non-worker runtimes |

Every runtime is an isolated Docker Compose profile defined in `docker/benchmarks.compose.yml`. Each run receives its
own PostgreSQL and Valkey containers and uses the same source tree mounted at `/app`. The PostgreSQL database is seeded
from `docker/postgres/initdb.d/10-benchmark.sql`.

The runtime configs use a production-oriented benchmark baseline:

- All runtimes start 20 PHP execution workers. FrankenPHP worker mode reserves one additional thread for
  non-worker requests. PHP-FPM uses a static pool, avoiding worker ramp-up during measurement.
- Every PHP image loads `php.ini-production` plus `docker/runtimes/php-production.ini`: OPcache is enabled
  for web and CLI SAPIs, JIT is disabled, errors go to stderr, and PHP memory is limited to 256 MiB.
- OPcache timestamp validation is disabled. **Restart the runtime after changing PHP files**, including
  files in the mounted source tree. The benchmark suite rebuilds and restarts each runtime automatically.
- FPM, FreeUnit, Rapira and FrankenPHP workers recycle after 10,000 requests; RoadRunner uses its
  memory supervisor. OxPHP has no request-count recycling, so its workers live for the whole run. API body limits are 8 MiB, and request/queue timeouts are configured where supported.
- HTTP readiness checks gate benchmark startup. Containers have a 45-second shutdown grace period,
  bounded Docker logs, and an increased open-file limit. Nginx access logging is disabled to match the
  other servers, while errors remain logged. FastCGI keepalive is intentionally disabled so idle Nginx
  connections cannot reserve the smaller FPM worker pool.
- Each endpoint receives a separate unmeasured warm-up before load and resource samples are recorded.

These are production-like application-server settings for a controlled local benchmark. HTTP on port 9991,
bind-mounted application code, disposable database storage and benchmark credentials remain intentional;
a deployed service still needs its own TLS ingress, secrets and persistent database storage. Worker counts
must be sized for the deployment's CPU and memory budget. Historical results use the configs in effect when
they were recorded and must be rerun to compare this baseline.

Server releases checked on 2026-09-22 are pinned in the benchmark Dockerfile and Compose file:

| Component | Version |
| --- | --- |
| PHP / PHP-FPM | [8.5.10](https://www.php.net/downloads.php) |
| FrankenPHP | [1.12.7](https://github.com/php/frankenphp/releases/tag/v1.12.7) |
| RoadRunner | [2025.1.15](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/releases/tag/v2025.1.15) |
| FreeUnit | [1.36.1](https://github.com/freeunitorg/freeunit/releases/tag/1.36.1) |
| Rapira (all modes) | [0.8.1](https://github.com/rapira-rs/rapira/releases/tag/v0.8.1) |
| OxPHP (both modes) | [nightly e05777b0](https://github.com/oxphp/oxphp/commit/e05777b03cb085c7e27d9f2d0bc4b3afa836a6b7) |
| Nginx | [1.31.6 (mainline)](https://nginx.org/en/download.html) |
| PostgreSQL | [18.6](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/) |
| Valkey | [9.1.2](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/releases/tag/9.1.2) |

FreeUnit's published `latest-php8.5` image still contains 1.35.5. Its build target therefore compiles
the checksummed 1.36.1 release source against PHP 8.5.10, with TLS and compression support. Optional
JavaScript routing and OpenTelemetry modules are not built; the benchmark does not use them.
OxPHP is built from its nightly PHP 8.5 image for commit `e05777b0`, pinned by digest (linux/amd64 only). No
release includes that commit yet, and it matters here: with OxPHP 0.11.0 a client that hung up mid-request could
leave a persistent Valkey or PostgreSQL connection out of sync, and the suite's end-of-stage disconnects turned that
into 500 responses. The nightly image ships PHP 8.5.11 rather than 8.5.10. Like every OxPHP image it is Alpine-based
and ZTS; the other runtimes use Debian images. The base image changes the bundled libpq: Alpine 3.23 ships
libpq 18, where `pdo_pgsql` closes a prepared statement with a protocol-level message, while Debian bookworm ships
libpq 15, where it sends a separate `DEALLOCATE` statement and waits for the reply. The application code and the
queries it runs are the same, but `/postgres/orders` results include that difference.

OxPHP is configured through environment variables, kept in `docker/runtimes/oxphp.env` and
`docker/runtimes/oxphp-classic.env`. Both containers run as root like the FrankenPHP, RoadRunner and Rapira
containers (`oxphp serve --user=root`); without it OxPHP drops to `www-data` after binding.

Version pins should be refreshed from upstream releases when updating the benchmark baseline.

Two endpoints are benchmarked:

- `/` measures framework and runtime overhead with a minimal response.
- `/postgres/orders` measures a database-backed request that reads joined `orders` and `customers` rows through
  `yiisoft/db-pgsql` and persistent PDO connections.

Load is generated by a pinned build of [wrkx](https://github.com/devhands-io/wrkx), a maintained wrk2 derivative with
constant-throughput load and coordinated-omission-aware latency recording. Docker CPU and memory usage are sampled
alongside the HTTP results.

## Requirements

- Linux with Docker Engine and the Docker Compose v2 plugin.
- GNU Make and Bash.
- Git for contributing.
- Enough available CPU, memory, disk space, and time to build all runtime images.
- Port `9991` available on the host.

PHP, Composer, wrkx, PostgreSQL, and Valkey do not need to be installed on the host for benchmark runs. The first run
is slower because Docker must download and build the runtime images; later runs reuse cached layers.

## Quick start

Clone the repository and run the complete matrix:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Yii3-Benchmarks/app-api.git
cd app-api
make bench-all
```

This command sequentially:

1. Builds and starts each runtime with isolated PostgreSQL and Valkey services.
2. Waits for the stack and endpoint preflight check to succeed.
3. Benchmarks `/` and `/postgres/orders` with wrkx.
4. Captures application, database, and cache resource usage.
5. Stops the stack and removes its volumes before moving to the next runtime.
6. Generates one self-contained HTML report for the complete suite.

Results are written to a timestamped directory:

```text
runtime/benchmarks/<timestamp>-suite/
├── <timestamp>-<runtime>-<target>-<mode>/
│   ├── metadata.env
│   ├── summary.json
│   ├── wrkx-timeseries.json
│   ├── wrkx-*.log
│   └── docker-stats.csv
└── report.html
```

## Running selected benchmarks

Benchmark one runtime and the minimal endpoint:

```shell
make bench RUNTIME=roadrunner MODE=steady RATE=8000 DURATION=60s
```

Benchmark its PostgreSQL endpoint:

```shell
make bench-db RUNTIME=php-fpm MODE=steady RATE=4000 DURATION=60s
```

Benchmark all Rapira modes on both endpoints:

```shell
make bench-all RUNTIMES="rapira rapira-classic rapira-dispatcher"
```

All Rapira modes use the pinned `0.8.1-php8.5` server image and the same `worker-rapira.php` entry point.
The Yii runner detects the configured mode: classic handles one request per application bootstrap, while worker
and dispatcher keep the application in memory. `rapira` continues to select worker mode.
Its Yii runner and PHP contract currently
require development packages; Composer records their exact revisions in the local lock file.

Run a subset of runtimes through both endpoints:

```shell
make bench-all RUNTIMES="frankenphp-worker roadrunner freeunit"
```

The underlying suite script also accepts a target subset:

```shell
RUNTIMES="roadrunner freeunit" TARGETS="home" MODE=steady RATE=5000 DURATION=60s \
    ./tools/run-benchmark-suite.sh
```

To start a runtime without benchmarking it:

```shell
make runtime-up RUNTIME=frankenphp-worker
curl http://localhost:9991/
curl http://localhost:9991/postgres/orders
make runtime-down RUNTIME=frankenphp-worker
```

`runtime-down` removes the selected runtime's database and cache volumes. Do not use it if you need to preserve manual
changes made inside those benchmark containers.

## Benchmark configuration

The default mode is `ramp`. Configuration is passed as Make variables or environment variables.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RUNTIME` | `frankenphp-classic` | Runtime used by `make bench` and `make bench-db` |
| `RUNTIMES` | all eight runtimes | Space-separated runtimes used by `make bench-all` |
| `TARGETS` | `home postgres-orders` | Space-separated endpoint keys for the suite script |
| `MODE` | `ramp` | `steady` for one rate or `ramp` for sequential rate stages |
| `RATE` | `10000` | Requests per second in steady mode |
| `DURATION` | `160s` | Steady-mode duration |
| `THREADS` | host CPU count | wrkx worker threads |
| `CONNECTIONS` | `256` | Concurrent HTTP connections |
| `WARMUP_DURATION` | `10s` | Unmeasured warm-up per endpoint; `0s` disables it |
| `WARMUP_RATE` | `1000` | Requests per second during warm-up |
| `STAGES` | thirteen stages from 2.5k to 200k RPS | JSON stage list for ramp mode |
| `OUTPUT_ROOT` | timestamped suite directory | Result destination |

Example custom ramp:

```shell
STAGES='[{"target":1000,"duration":"30s"},{"target":3000,"duration":"30s"}]' \
    make bench RUNTIME=freeunit MODE=ramp
```

wrkx does not change rate continuously during a run. Ramp mode executes each `STAGES` entry as a separate
constant-rate run and records one aggregate point per stage. wrkx uses an initial calibration period, so stages shorter
than 20 seconds are not recommended.

## Reports

The generated HTML report compares issued and successful RPS, errors, average and p95 latency,
application CPU, and application memory. Charts are grouped into worker/non-worker and DB/non-DB comparisons.
DB and non-DB summary tables show Successful RPS and Target RPS at the cap in separate sortable columns,
sorted by Successful RPS descending by default, with unreached caps last. Stage-based runs mark the first stage more than 5% below target as the cap; this can
reflect server or load-generator saturation. The default ramp extends to 200k RPS to test beyond the old 50k ceiling.
It is self-contained and can be opened directly in a browser or attached to an issue.

Regenerate a report from existing results:

```shell
make bench-report INPUT=runtime/benchmarks/<suite-directory>
```

Combine explicitly selected runs:

```shell
make bench-report INPUT="runtime/benchmarks/<run-1> runtime/benchmarks/<run-2>"
```

Raw wrkx output and exact run settings are retained next to the compact data. Include them when reporting unexpected
results; an HTML chart alone is usually insufficient to reproduce a finding.

The remaining application-template Docker files support development and tests. The benchmark matrix specifically uses
`docker/benchmarks.compose.yml` and `docker/runtimes/`.

## Testing changes

Install or update project dependencies through the development container when needed:

```shell
make composer-update
```

Run the automated checks relevant to your change:

```shell
make test
docker compose -f docker/benchmarks.compose.yml --profile roadrunner config --quiet
bash -n tools/run-benchmark-suite.sh tools/run-wrkx-benchmark.sh
```

Before submitting benchmark-related changes, run at least one short steady benchmark for the affected runtime. Use a
duration of 20 seconds or more so wrkx calibration is meaningful:

```shell
make bench RUNTIME=roadrunner MODE=steady RATE=100 DURATION=20s THREADS=2 CONNECTIONS=8
```

Changes that affect shared application behavior should be checked against every runtime with `make bench-all` when
practical.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome for runtime upgrades, new application servers, benchmark correctness, reporting, and
reproducibility improvements.

1. Create a branch from `master`.
2. Keep shared application behavior identical across runtimes. Runtime-specific code belongs in `docker/runtimes/` or
   a clearly named worker entry point.
3. Add or update tests and documentation with the implementation.
4. Run the checks above and record the exact smoke benchmark command you used.
5. Open a pull request describing the motivation, affected runtimes, validation performed, and any compatibility or
   performance tradeoffs. Do not present performance changes without the host and benchmark configuration.

### Adding a runtime

To add another application server:

1. Add a named build target to `docker/runtimes/Dockerfile` and its configuration under `docker/runtimes/`.
2. Add a matching profile and service to `docker/benchmarks.compose.yml`, exposing the application on host port
   `9991`.
3. Add the runtime key, readable label, and resource-sampled service names to `tools/run-benchmark-suite.sh`.
4. Add required PHP packages to `composer.json`; keep one shared lock file.
5. Add the runtime to the `RUNTIMES` default in `Makefile` and to the table in this README.
6. Verify `/` and `/postgres/orders`, run a short steady benchmark, and confirm report generation and automatic
   teardown.

Avoid committing generated benchmark output unless it is intentionally used as a published reference result. Never
change only one runtime's application logic to improve its score—the suite must compare equivalent work.
